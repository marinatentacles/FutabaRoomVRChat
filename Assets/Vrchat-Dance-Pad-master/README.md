Version 2.0:
Full Body Tracking Support




# Vrchat-Dance-Pad
An InStation pad that relys on Final IK to disable Fullbody tracking for dance animations

# Things to have imported before using
1. VRCHAT VRCSDK
2. FINAL IK (I used 1.6.1 but newer versions should be fine)


# How to Use
1. Extract the Prefab Folder and Meta file into the ASSETS folder
2. Go to the tools folder and follow the steps on how to add the The IK Disabling to your dance
3. Select your new Dance and check the following in the Inspector
	- Loop Time 		(UNCHECKED unless you want it endless)
	- Bake into Pose 	(ALL CHECKED)
	- Based Upon 		(Original...and maybe feet on Y in some cases)
2. Drop _DancePad Prefab into scene
3. Add your dance animation to the 'CustomDance' Override Controller
4. Bam! You're done, have a cupcake.
